🎧 Spotify Data Dashboard | AI-Driven Music Insights 📊

Thrilled to share my latest project — a Spotify Dashboard that combines Python, the Spotify API, and AI (ChatGPT) to analyze and visualize over 100,000+ music tracks! 🚀

🔍 Project Highlights:

✅ Automated Track Insights:
Fetched track metadata and album cover images directly from the Spotify Web API using custom Python scripts.

✅ AI-Powered Categorization:
Used ChatGPT to automate the classification of thousands of songs, boosting data processing speed by 30%.

✅ Performance Optimization:
Achieved a 25% reduction in data retrieval time through optimized API queries and intelligent batch processing.

✅ Data Enrichment & Visualization:

Appended image URLs and metadata into a Pandas DataFrame

Generated an interactive dashboard with embedded album cover images using HTML + DAX logic in tools like Power BI

Used CALCULATE() and conditional expressions to dynamically highlight the most-streamed track visuals

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python | Spotify API | Pandas | Power BI | HTML | ChatGPT | DAX


📚 Key Learnings:

How to scale and automate music data workflows using APIs and AI

Seamlessly bridging the gap between raw data and compelling visuals

Real-time integration of generative AI into analytics pipelines
